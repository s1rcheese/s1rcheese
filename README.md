### Hello people! ðŸ‘‹
## I am s1r_cheese and I like to make random stuff I came up with in my mind.

I can code in JavaScript, Java, C#, HTML(5), and CSS.

I like reverse engineering things as well.

I am currently a Dev at a server named DreamDimensions.

I also am working on a top-secert project. What is it? I haven't decided yet (BTW if you contact me please tell me something cool I can make because I can not think of it).
## Ok thank you!
